# Staff Kickoff Briefing Script – Enterprise Application Project (EAP)

## Purpose of this script

This script is used by staff to **introduce the Enterprise Application Project (EAP)** to interns in a consistent, professional, and aligned way.

The goal of the kickoff is to:
- set expectations clearly;
- explain roles and responsibilities;
- establish trust and ownership;
- avoid mixed messages later in the project.

This script reflects all **approved governance, intern-facing documents, and execution planning**.

---

## 1. Opening the project

**Suggested wording:**

> “Welcome to the Enterprise Application Project.  
> This project is set up as a professional software development project, not as a classroom exercise.”

Key points to communicate:
- interns are trusted with real responsibility;
- staff will coach and observe, not run the project;
- learning happens through doing, not through instructions.

---

## 2. Explaining the project context

**Suggested wording:**

> “You will work in a Scrum team and deliver a real product.  
> You are responsible for planning, quality, and delivery.”

Emphasise:
- Scrum is the working framework;
- quality and delivery matter;
- problems and defects are normal in real projects.

Avoid:
- talking about assessments in detail;
- mentioning incidents or simulations.

---

## 3. Clarifying team roles

Explain clearly and explicitly:

### Product Owner
- One intern is the Product Owner.
- The Product Owner decides scope and priorities.
- Staff do not take product decisions.

### Scrum Master
- One intern is the Scrum Master.
- The Scrum Master facilitates Scrum events.
- Staff act as Scrum Coaches, not Scrum Masters.

### DevOps responsibility
- DevOps is a team responsibility.
- One or more interns take a leading role.
- Pipelines, deployments, and operational issues belong to the team.

**Suggested wording:**

> “These roles belong to you.  
> Staff will not take them over.”

---

## 4. How planning works

Explain:
- Sprint length is two weeks;
- Sprint Planning happens every Sprint;
- backlog items must be ready before entering a Sprint.

Introduce:
- Definition of Ready (DoR);
- Definition of Done (DoD).

**Suggested wording:**

> “The Definition of Ready helps you decide what can be planned.  
> The Definition of Done helps you decide what is finished.  
> These are team agreements.”

---

## 5. Quality and professionalism

Make expectations explicit:

- code is reviewed;
- tests run in the pipeline;
- delivery issues are handled professionally;
- transparency is expected.

**Suggested wording:**

> “Mistakes are allowed.  
> Ignoring problems is not.”

---

## 6. How staff will act

Be explicit about staff posture:

- staff act as Scrum Coaches;
- staff act as sponsors;
- staff observe and challenge;
- staff do not solve problems for the team.

**Suggested wording:**

> “If we step in too much, we are doing something wrong.”

---

## 7. Communication and collaboration

Explain:
- one office day per week;
- remote work on other days;
- Microsoft Teams as the main collaboration tool.

Encourage:
- open communication;
- asking questions early;
- making decisions visible.

---

## 8. Closing the kickoff

End with clarity and trust.

**Suggested wording:**

> “You are trusted to run this project professionally.  
> Use that trust.  
> Reflect, improve, and take ownership.”

Invite questions, but avoid:
- detailed technical discussions;
- solving problems during the kickoff.

---

## Final reminder for staff

- Stick to this script.
- Avoid adding personal interpretations.
- Consistency across staff is critical.

This kickoff sets the tone for the entire project.
