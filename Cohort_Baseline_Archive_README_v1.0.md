# Cohort Baseline Archive (CBA) – README

## Purpose of the Cohort Baseline Archive

The **Cohort Baseline Archive (CBA)** contains the complete and approved documentation set that defines the rules, expectations, and governance for a specific cohort of the **Enterprise Application Project (EAP)**.

The CBA exists to:
- ensure fairness and transparency for interns;
- guarantee consistency and discipline among staff;
- provide traceability for assessment, evaluation, and audits;
- enable safe improvement between cohorts without retroactive changes.

Once frozen, the CBA represents the **authoritative baseline** for the cohort.

## What “baseline” means

A baseline means that:
- all documents in this archive are approved;
- the content applies to the entire cohort;
- no silent or informal changes are allowed during execution.

A baseline does **not** mean:
- teams cannot adapt their working agreements;
- learning and reflection stop;
- improvements are forbidden.

It means that **governance, roles, and expectations remain stable**.

## When this archive is frozen

This archive is frozen:
- after project kickoff;
- before or at the start of Sprint 1;
- once all required documents have been approved.

After freezing:
- documents may be referenced and enforced;
- changes require a new major version and apply only to future cohorts.

## Precedence and hierarchy

In case of questions or conflicts:
1. The **PID** takes precedence over all other documents.
2. Approved staff governance documents define boundaries and posture.
3. Operational Execution Planning enables execution within those boundaries.
4. Intern-facing documents define how the team works day to day.

No document in this archive may contradict a higher-level document.

## Use during the cohort

During the cohort:
- staff refer to this archive when coaching, observing, or assessing;
- interns are guided based on the approved intern-facing documents;
- discussions about expectations should always reference this baseline.

If something is unclear, the archive is the **first point of reference**.

---

## After the cohort

After the cohort:
- reflections and lessons learned may be documented separately;
- proposed changes are collected outside this archive;
- a new baseline is created for the next cohort if needed.

The CBA itself remains unchanged as a historical record.

---

## Final note

> The Cohort Baseline Archive protects both interns and staff  
> by making expectations explicit, stable, and defensible.

This README defines how the archive should be understood and used.
