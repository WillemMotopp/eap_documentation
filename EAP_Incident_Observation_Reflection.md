### Interpersonal Conflict (NEW)

**When team members have conflict about decisions, roles, or communication:**

**Observe:**
- Nature of conflict (technical disagreement, role conflict, personal tension)
- How do parties communicate? (direct/indirect, mature/defensive)
- Does anyone take informal "lead" role inappropriately?
- Communication medium used (face-to-face, chat, email, passive-aggressive)
- Emotional regulation (calm discussion vs. heated argument vs. withdrawal)
- Willingness to listen to other perspectives

**Staff Intervention:**
- What coaching was provided?
- Did staff solve it or coach team members to solve it themselves?
- Was face-to-face communication enforced for emotional topics?
- Was team member given ownership of resolving conflict?

**Resolution:**
- Did parties have the difficult conversation?
- What was the outcome?
- What did team members learn from the conflict?
- Did resolution improve or harm team dynamics?

**Staff Reflection:**
- Did I maintain appropriate coaching boundaries?
- Did I coach autonomy or create dependency?
- Was my intervention too much or too little?
- What would I do differently next time?

**Follow-up Needed:** 
- [ ] Yes - check in next week
- [ ] No - resolved and closed

**Confidentiality:**
This section remains **strictly confidential** (staff only). 
Do not share specifics with other team members without explicit permission from involved parties.
