# Definition of Ready (Template)

Each team creates its own Definition of Ready.  
Use this template as a starting point.

A backlog item is **Ready** when the team agrees that it can be planned and worked on in a Sprint.

## Clarity
- The goal of the item is clear
- The value for the product or user is understood
- Acceptance criteria are written and understandable

## Scope
- The item is small enough to be completed within one Sprint
- Dependencies are identified
- Open questions are known and discussed

## Feasibility (including DevOps)
- The team understands in general how the work can be done
- Required environments, services, or integrations are known
- Needed access, secrets, or configuration are identified

## Quality & Testing
- The team knows how the work can be tested
- Relevant test types are considered (for example: unit or integration tests)

## Delivery awareness
- The team understands how this item will be delivered through the pipeline
- No known blocking issues in CI/CD or deployment exist

## Agreement
- The Product Owner agrees the item is ready
- The team agrees the item can be taken into a Sprint
