# ADR-003: React Version and Component Library

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Team discussed using React v18 vs React v19 for the frontend.

**React v18 Arguments:**
- Team member has experience with v18
- Specific library available (Ant Design / [library name])
- Proven stability

**React v19 Arguments:**
- Latest version with performance improvements
- Better preparation for Dutch IT market
- Mainstream ecosystem and community support
- Modern best practices (concurrent rendering, automatic batching)

## Decision
We will use **React v19** with mainstream component libraries.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Team learns latest React features
- Better alignment with industry trends
- Strong community support and documentation
- Modern performance patterns

**Negative:**
- Team member's v18 experience less directly applicable
- Slightly newer, less battle-tested
- Team needs to learn v19 specifics

**Mitigation:**
- Team member with React experience helps team learn concepts
- React fundamentals are same across versions
- Focus on learning over leveraging existing knowledge

## Constraints
- **Opleidingsdoel:** Prepare trainees for Dutch corporate IT market
- **Community:** Prefer mainstream libraries with large European/global community
- **Maintenance:** Avoid libraries with small or region-specific communities

## Category
**Platform Decision** - Staff approved after team input

## Deciders
Staff (after team discussion)

## Notes
This decision prioritizes learning goals and market preparation over 
leveraging existing team member experience. Team member's React knowledge 
remains valuable for teaching concepts to other team members.
