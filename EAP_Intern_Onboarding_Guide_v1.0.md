# Intern Onboarding Guide – Enterprise Application Project (EAP)

## Purpose of this guide

Welcome to the **Enterprise Application Project (EAP)**.

This guide explains:
- how you are expected to work as a team;
- which roles exist and who holds them;
- how planning and delivery are organised;
- what “quality” means in this project.

This guide gives you **context and expectations**.  
Detailed rules, templates, and agreements are provided in separate documents.

---

## The project mindset

This project is set up as a **professional software development project**.

That means:
- you work in a Scrum team;
- you take responsibility for planning, quality, and delivery;
- problems, defects, and operational issues are part of normal work;
- staff support and coach you, but do not take over your roles.

You are expected to act as a **professional team**, not as students following step-by-step instructions.

---

## Team roles and responsibilities

### Product Owner (team role)

One team member acts as the **Product Owner**.

The Product Owner:
- defines and orders the Product Backlog;
- clarifies requirements and acceptance criteria;
- makes scope and priority decisions;
- represents stakeholder interests within the team.

The Product Owner role is held by a **team member**, not by staff.

Staff may act as stakeholders or advisors, but they do **not** make product decisions.

---

### Scrum Master (team role)

One team member acts as the **Scrum Master**.

The Scrum Master:
- facilitates Scrum events;
- ensures Scrum rules and timeboxes are respected;
- helps the team identify and remove impediments;
- supports transparency and collaboration within the team.

The Scrum Master is a **team role**, not a staff role.

Staff members act as **Scrum Coaches**.  
They support and challenge the Scrum Master, but they do **not** run Scrum events or take over the Scrum Master’s responsibilities.

---

### DevOps responsibility (team responsibility)

One or more team members take responsibility for **DevOps activities**, such as:
- CI/CD pipelines;
- deployments;
- monitoring and logs;
- operational issues.

DevOps is a **team responsibility**.

You are expected to:
- detect problems early;
- investigate delivery and pipeline failures;
- communicate clearly about operational issues;
- work together on recovery or rollback when needed.

---

### Shared responsibility

All team members contribute to building, testing, improving, and operating the product.

You share responsibility for:
- achieving the Sprint Goal;
- product quality;
- professional behaviour;
- collaboration and communication.

---

## How you plan work

### Definition of Ready

Before work is taken into a Sprint, the team agrees that a backlog item is **Ready**.

This means:
- the goal of the item is clear;
- the value for the product or user is understood;
- acceptance criteria are written and understandable;
- the item is small enough to be completed within one Sprint;
- dependencies and open questions are known;
- technical and DevOps implications are considered.

The Definition of Ready supports **good Sprint Planning**.

It does **not** remove responsibility from the Product Owner or the team.  
It helps you make better decisions together.

---

## How you deliver work

### Definition of Done

Work is only considered **Done** when the team agrees it meets the Definition of Done.

This includes:
- code that is readable and reviewed;
- automated tests that run as part of the pipeline;
- a successful build;
- deployment in the target environment (if applicable);
- predictable behaviour under failure conditions;
- clear logging and recovery or rollback options;
- updated documentation where needed.

“Done” means:
- ready to show in a Sprint Demo;
- ready to be used by others.

---

## Scrum events

You work in **Sprints of two weeks** and use the Scrum framework.

The Scrum events are:
- Sprint Planning;
- Daily Scrum;
- Sprint Review (Demo);
- Retrospective.

The Scrum Master facilitates these events.  
The Product Owner ensures clarity of goals and priorities.

All team members participate actively.

---

## Professional expectations

In this project:
- problems and defects are normal;
- delivery issues may occur;
- not everything will go as planned.

What matters is **how you respond**:
- investigate calmly;
- communicate clearly;
- respect quality and agreed processes;
- make decisions as a team.

This project focuses on **professional behaviour**, not on avoiding mistakes.

---

## Final note

You are trusted with real responsibility.

Use that trust well:
- talk to each other;
- make decisions explicit;
- reflect and improve every Sprint.

Staff are here to **coach and challenge**, not to solve problems for you.
