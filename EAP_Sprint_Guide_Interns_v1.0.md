# EAP Sprint Guide for Interns

## Purpose
This guide explains how the Scrum team works during the EAP project and what is expected from team members in each sprint.

---


## Shared responsibility

All team members contribute to building, testing, improving, and operating the product, and share responsibility for achieving the Sprint Goal.

---

## Product Owner role

One team member acts as the **Product Owner**.

The Product Owner is responsible for:
- defining and ordering the Product Backlog;
- clarifying requirements and acceptance criteria;
- making scope and priority decisions;
- representing stakeholder interests within the team.

The Product Owner role is held by a **team member**, not by staff.

Staff may act as stakeholders or advisors, but they do **not** make product decisions.

---

## Scrum Master role

One team member acts as the **Scrum Master**.

The Scrum Master is responsible for:
- facilitating Scrum events;
- ensuring Scrum rules and timeboxes are respected;
- helping the team identify and remove impediments;
- supporting collaboration and transparency within the team.

The Scrum Master is a **team role**, not a staff role.

Staff members act as **Scrum Coaches**. They support and challenge the Scrum Master, but they do not run Scrum events or take over the Scrum Master’s responsibilities.

---

## Professional responsibility

Software development in a professional environment includes dealing with:
- defects,
- operational issues,
- delivery problems,
- unexpected behaviour in systems or pipelines.

Teams are expected to handle these situations calmly, transparently, and professionally as part of normal software development work.

---

## Scrum ceremonies
Details of Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review (Demo), and Retrospective are applied as agreed within the team and guided by the Scrum Master.
