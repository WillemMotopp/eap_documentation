# Operational Execution Planning – Sprint 0 / Week 1

## Purpose of this document

This document ensures that the **Enterprise Application Project (EAP)** can be executed as designed from the first Sprint onward.

It translates approved governance, roles, and expectations into **practical execution conditions**.

This document is **staff-only** and must not be shared with interns.

---

## Core principle

> Staff create the conditions for execution.  
> Interns execute, decide, and learn.

This document exists to prevent:
- unclear expectations,
- late staff intervention,
- inconsistent execution across cohorts.

---


## Relation to the Project Initiation Document (PID)

The Project Initiation Document (PID) defines:
- the product vision and scope;
- project objectives and constraints;
- high-level roles and responsibilities;
- success criteria.

This document does **not** replace the PID.

Operational Execution Planning:
- assumes the PID is approved and stable;
- translates PID decisions into executable conditions;
- must remain consistent with the PID at all times.

If a conflict arises between documents, the PID takes precedence.

## Before Sprint 1 (Sprint 0 activities)

### 1. Team and role confirmation

Ensure that:
- the Product Owner role is assigned to an intern;
- the Scrum Master role is assigned to an intern;
- DevOps responsibility is explicitly assigned to one or more interns.

Roles must be **explicitly named**, not implied.

Staff must not hold any of these roles.

---

### 2. Repositories and tooling

Ensure that:
- all required GitHub repositories exist;
- access rights are correct for all team members;
- Git Flow is agreed and visible:
  - `main` and `dev` branches exist;
  - branch protection rules are active;
  - pull requests are required for merging.

Ensure that:
- a digital Scrum board exists;
- columns reflect the team’s workflow.

---

### 3. CI/CD baseline

Ensure that:
- a basic CI pipeline runs on pull requests;
- relevant automated tests are executed in the pipeline;
- pipeline results are visible to the team.

The pipeline does **not** need to be perfect.  
It must be **real and observable**.

---

### 4. Definition of Ready and Definition of Done

Ensure that:
- the team has read the approved DoR and DoD templates;
- the team discusses them together;
- the team agrees to use them as a starting point.

Staff must not rewrite or impose DoR/DoD content.

---

## Sprint rhythm and ceremonies

Ensure clarity on:
- Sprint length: **2 weeks**
- Sprint Planning is facilitated by the Scrum Master
- Backlog items meet the DoR
- Sprint Review (Demo) and Retrospective occur every Sprint

---

## Office day vs remote work

The team has:
- **one office day per week**;
- remaining days remote.

Ensure that:
- at least one key Scrum event uses the office day effectively;
- Microsoft Teams is used consistently for collaboration.

---

## DevOps operational ownership

Ensure that:
- interns with DevOps responsibility monitor the pipeline;
- pipeline failures are treated as team issues;
- delivery risks are discussed openly.

Staff must not:
- fix pipelines for the team;
- bypass quality gates;
- silently resolve operational issues.

---

## Sponsor role (staff responsibility)

Staff also act as **project sponsors**.

As sponsors, staff:
- represent organisational ownership of the project;
- safeguard continuity, relevance, and feasibility of the product;
- provide strategic direction when needed;
- act as escalation point for risks that exceed team authority.

As sponsors, staff **do not**:
- take over Product Owner decisions;
- prioritise backlog items;
- redefine scope within a Sprint.

The sponsor role exists alongside Scrum Coach and governance roles and must be exercised with restraint.

---

## Staff posture during execution

Staff act as:
- Scrum Coaches;
- stakeholders;
- sponsors;
- platform and governance authority.

Staff must:
- ask questions;
- challenge reasoning;
- observe behaviour and decision-making.

Staff must not:
- take over Scrum roles;
- make product decisions;
- solve technical problems for the team.

---

## When to intervene

Intervene only when:
- safety, ethics, or respect are at risk;
- governance boundaries are crossed;
- assessment integrity is threatened;
- operational risk becomes unacceptable without visibility.

Interventions should:
- be minimal;
- focus on behaviour and boundaries;
- be documented briefly for staff context.

---

## Final reminder

> If staff feel the need to “rescue” the team,  
> something earlier in this checklist was missed.

This document exists to prevent that situation.
